# 006 — Backtester

## Purpose
Let an LP simulate what would have actually happened if they'd provided concentrated liquidity for a pair over a chosen range and period, so a range decision is grounded in historical fee/IL outcomes instead of a single static estimate.

## User Stories
- As an LP deciding on a range, I want to simulate that range against historical price data, so I can see how it would have performed instead of guessing.
- As an LP, I want to see estimated fees earned versus estimated impermanent loss for a simulated position, so I understand the actual net outcome, not just one side of it.
- As an LP, I want to see how often and when I would have gone out of range, so I understand the maintenance burden of the range I'm considering.
- As an LP who found a specific pool via `005 Pool Explorer`, I want to start a simulation pre-filled with that pool's fee tier and current conditions, so I don't have to re-enter information I already found.
- As an LP comparing options, I want to run two or three range scenarios against the same pair and period, so I can see the tradeoffs side by side instead of one simulation at a time.

## UI Layout
- **Entry points:** from `003 Pair Analysis` (Fee/IL preview → "Run full backtest"), from `005 Pool Explorer` (pool-specific simulation, pre-filled with that pool's fee tier and current TVL), and standalone from nav with manual pair/range entry.
- **Simulation setup panel:** pair (Asset A / Asset B, pre-filled if arriving from elsewhere), range (min/max price or % width), time period, and pool fee tier (pre-filled if known, otherwise selectable).
- **Results summary:** net outcome at a glance — estimated fees earned, estimated impermanent loss, net P&L, % of time in range — presented together so net outcome is the headline, not buried under separate fee and IL numbers.
- **Time-in-range timeline:** visual timeline of the simulated period showing when the position was in vs. out of range, so the user sees the maintenance pattern, not just an aggregate percentage.
- **Scenario comparison view:** ability to add a second/third range scenario for the same pair and period, shown side by side with the same summary fields, so tradeoffs are visible without re-running from scratch.
- **Link to ORT:** simulated pair's canonical 90d ORT score (from `004 ORT Engine`) shown for context next to the results, so the user can sanity-check the simulation against the pair's general standing.

## Components
- `SimulationSetupForm` — pair/range/period/fee-tier inputs, supports pre-fill from upstream pages.
- `BacktestResultsSummary` — fees earned / IL / net P&L / time-in-range headline.
- `TimeInRangeTimeline` — visual in-range vs. out-of-range timeline for the simulated period.
- `ScenarioComparisonPanel` — side-by-side multi-scenario results for the same pair/period.
- `ORTContextChip` — reused/adapted from `003`'s `ORTPreviewChip`, shown alongside results.

## Data Requirements
- Historical price series for both assets across the requested period (from the Asset data model), at sufficient granularity to detect range exits accurately (daily granularity may understate exits for volatile pairs — this needs a defined minimum granularity, likely finer than daily, to avoid materially undercounting rebalances).
- Historical volume and TVL for the relevant pool (or pair-level aggregate if no specific pool was selected), to estimate fees earned proportional to the simulated position's share of liquidity.
- Range definition: min/max price bounds, derived from either user input or a translated %-width input.
- Computed per simulation: time in range, number of range exits, estimated fees earned (based on volume × fee tier × estimated share of in-range liquidity), impermanent loss estimate (based on price divergence from entry), net P&L.
- Stored simulation results (so a user can revisit a past simulation rather than only ever seeing the most recent run) — exact persistence model TBD, but at minimum the inputs + outputs of a run should be reproducible, not ephemeral-only.

## API Requirements
- `POST /backtest` — accepts pair, range, period, and optional pool/fee-tier; returns the full results object (fees, IL, net P&L, time-in-range, exit timeline).
- `GET /backtest/:simulationId` — retrieve a previously run simulation (supports revisiting and scenario comparison without re-running).
- Depends on: Asset historical price data (existing), Pool/pair volume and TVL data (`003`/`005`), and a defined minimum data granularity for accurate range-exit detection — this spec assumes that granularity decision is made in `Architecture.md`/`Database.md`, not decided here.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A simulation run with valid pair/range/period inputs returns fees, IL, net P&L, and time-in-range together — never a partial result.
- [ ] Time-in-range timeline accurately reflects the number and approximate timing of range exits at the granularity the underlying data supports — and that granularity is disclosed to the user (e.g. "based on daily closes," so a sophisticated user understands the resolution limitation rather than assuming intraday precision).
- [ ] Pre-filled entry from `003` or `005` correctly carries over pair, fee tier, and any known pool context — no silent drop of upstream context.
- [ ] Running 2–3 scenarios for the same pair/period and comparing them shows consistent, comparable baselines (same price data, same period) — only the range/fee-tier inputs differ between scenarios.
- [ ] If historical data for the requested period is insufficient (e.g. a newly tracked asset with a short history), the simulation either shortens the period with a clear note, or declines to run with a clear reason — it does not silently extrapolate beyond available data.
- [ ] A simulation's stored inputs and outputs can be retrieved later and match what was originally computed (no silent recalculation drift between save and retrieval).
- [ ] ORT context chip reflects the canonical 90d score for the simulated pair and is clearly labeled as context, not as part of the simulation's own output.

## Future Enhancements
- Saving/naming simulations into a personal history, beyond raw retrieval by ID — likely ties into account/auth work not yet scoped.
- Direct hand-off from a backtest result into an actual on-chain LP action (Year 3 — Router) — explicitly out of scope now; this feature simulates, it does not execute.
- Auto-suggested ranges based on backtest results feeding back into a recommendation (Phase 5 — Range Suggestions / AI Commentary) — this spec produces the raw simulation data that feature would consume, not the recommendation itself.
- Regime-aware backtesting (e.g. flagging that a simulated period was unusually calm/volatile relative to the asset's longer history) — deferred to Phase 5 (Regime Classification), same dependency noted in `004 ORT Engine`'s Future Enhancements.
