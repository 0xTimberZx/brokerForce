 *
 *   1. OLS-regress priceB on priceA to get residuals.

 *   3. Score = max(0, 1 - rho), so a rho near 1 (residuals behave like a

 *      and a rho near 0 (residuals snap back quickly -- mean-reverting,
 *      cointegration-like behavior) scores near 1.
 *
 * This captures the right *direction* of the signal (more mean-reversion in
 * the spread = higher score) without the statistical rigor of a proper ADF
 * test (no unit-root null hypothesis, no critical values, no p-value). Treat
 * this as directionally useful, not as a substitute for real cointegration
 * testing if that rigor ever matters for a real decision downstream.
