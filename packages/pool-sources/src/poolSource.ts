// The seam between Pool Explorer's route/UI logic and wherever real pool
// data actually comes from. Built deliberately source-agnostic, since the
// real choice of data source (Uniswap Subgraph? DexScreener? GeckoTerminal?
// which chains first?) is a separate decision from how the route, caching,
// and frontend should behave -- that decision shouldn't block building
// everything around it.
//
// UnimplementedPoolSource below is what's actually wired in right now. It's
// not a mock or a fake -- it's an honest "this data doesn't exist yet"
// implementation, so the route layer is fully real and testable today
// without depending on a pending source decision. Swapping in a real source
// later means writing one new class that implements this interface and
// changing one line in routes/pools.ts -- nothing else in this file, the
// route, or the frontend needs to change.
